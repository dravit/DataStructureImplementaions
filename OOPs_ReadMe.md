# OOPs Principles

#### Encapsulation

- Encapsulation means that the internal representation of an object is generally hidden from outside of object's definition.
- Typically the object's own methods can directly inspect or manipulate its fields

#### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) 
- avoid duplication in code.

#### Encapsulate what changes 
- hides the implementation details, helps in maintenance

#### Open Closed Design Principle 
- Open for Extension but closed for Modification

#### SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) 
- One class should do only one and do it well

#### DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle) 
- Don't ask, let framework give you

#### Favour composition over inheritance 
- Code reuse without cost of inflexibility

#### LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle) 
- Sub type must be substitutable for super type

#### ISP (Interface Segregation Principle) 
- Avoid monolithic interface, reduce pain on client side

#### Programming for Interface 
- Helps in maintenance, improves flexibility

#### Delegation Principle 
- Don't do all thing by yourself, delegate it.
