/**
 * Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, â€¦, n).
 * Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
 * Starting from p, count up in increments of p and mark each of these numbers greater than p itself in the list.
 * These numbers will be 2p, 3p, 4p, etc.; note that some of them may have already been marked.
 * Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked.
 * If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this number (which is the next prime),
 * and repeat from step 3.

/**
 * Steps:
 * 1.   create an array of boolean of length n+1 and mark all of them as true.
 * 2.   Consider first p as 2 and run a loop having condition as p*p <= n and increment as p++
 * 3.   in this loop check if the boolean array has true on this index.
 * 4.   If it is true thn run another loop that starts counter from i=2*p, condition i<=n and increment it by i+=p
 * 5.   Mark all such values are false.
 * 6.   Print left out true from boolean array.
